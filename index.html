    <h1>Welcome to my blog....&#128515;</h1>
    <h3>I'm Hend, software learner</h3>
    <p>I'm interested in software, networks and learning many things related to them.</p>
    <p>My favourite OS is Linux even if I use windows! 	&#128517;</p>
    <p>Let's move on, but if you want to learn more about me, here you are <a href="about.html">More..</a></p>

            <h4>Coding is for everyone!</h4>
            <h6>Hend Elsayed &ensp; 24/12/2025  &#128336;</h6>
            <p>I think software is one of the fields that suits everyone regardless your academic study,</p>
            <p>maybe not all layers or stacks in software but for the coding itself is so easy onece you learnt the syntax,</p>
            <p>you can write simple programs, then if you want to go deeper, you have to spend more effort</p>
            <p>let's say it is easy to start, but like every thing else, if you want to become professional, you have to do more and keep learning.</p>

            <h4>Linux is the best!</h4>
            <h6>Hend Elsayed &ensp; 24/12/2025 &#128336;</h6>
            <p>For me Linux is the best os for different reasons,</p>
            <p>The main reason is that it's open sourse, there are different distros,</p>
            <p>Anyone has the knowledge and want to make their own disroes, they can.</p>
            <p>I want you to go and check linux history and search for its features.</p>

            <h6>Hend Elsayed &ensp; 24/12/2025 &#128336;</h6>
            <p>I realy hate this language &#128566;</p>
            <p>but I'm not that one who complains and see the dark side only,</p>
            <p>I remember when the first time i found that it was created only in 10 days,</p>
            <p>I felt like yeah now it makes sense, so i think it is better to know the circumstances so the pickture is more obvious.</p>

            <h4>Practice makes perfect</h4>
            <h6>Hend Elsayed &ensp; 24/12/2025 &#128336;</h6>
            <p>Practicing is very important for any skill to learn.</p>
            <p>It has a relation whis the consistancy which also a thing you have to reach.</p>

            <h4>Soft Skills..</h4>
            <h6>Hend Elsayed &ensp; 24/12/2025 &#128336;</h6>
            <p>Soft skills are important in any field not just fields where thalking or dealing whith others is needed.</p>
            <p>You can practice and learn it, at the end of the day these are skills.</p>
